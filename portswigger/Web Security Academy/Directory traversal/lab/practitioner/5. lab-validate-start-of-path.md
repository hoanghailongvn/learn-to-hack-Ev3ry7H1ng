# [Lab: File path traversal, validation of start of path](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-path-traversal/lab-validate-start-of-path)

If an application requires that the user-supplied filename must start with the expected base folder, such as `/var/www/images`, then it might be possible to include the required base folder followed by suitable traversal sequences. For example:

`filename=/var/www/images/../../../etc/passwd`
