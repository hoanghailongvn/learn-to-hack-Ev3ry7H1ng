Authentication is the process of verifying that a user really **is who they claim to be**, whereas authorization involves verifying whether a user **is allowed to do something**.

In the context of a website or web application, authentication determines whether someone attempting to access the site with the username `Carlos123` really is the same person who created the account.

Once `Carlos123` is authenticated, his permissions determine whether or not he is authorized, for example, to access personal information about other users or perform actions such as deleting another user's account.
