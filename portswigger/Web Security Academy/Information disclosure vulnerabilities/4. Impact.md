Information disclosure vulnerabilities can have both a direct and indirect impact depending on the purpose of the website and, therefore, what information an attacker is able to obtain. In some cases, the act of disclosing sensitive information alone can have a high impact on the affected parties. For example, an online shop leaking its customers' credit card details is likely to have severe consequences.

On the other hand, leaking technical information, such as the directory structure or which third-party frameworks are being used, may have little to no direct impact. However, in the wrong hands, this could be the key information required to construct any number of other exploits. The severity in this case depends on what the attacker is able to do with this information.
