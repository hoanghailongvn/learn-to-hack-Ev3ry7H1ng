# [Lab: Authentication bypass via information disclosure](https://portswigger.net/web-security/information-disclosure/exploiting/lab-infoleak-authentication-bypass)

## Lab
This lab's administration interface has an authentication bypass vulnerability, but it is impractical to exploit without knowledge of a custom HTTP header used by the front-end.

To solve the lab, obtain the header name then use it to bypass the lab's authentication. Access the admin interface and delete Carlos's account.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter

## Solution
