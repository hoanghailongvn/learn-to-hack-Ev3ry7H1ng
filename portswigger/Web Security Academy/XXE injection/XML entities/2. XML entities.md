XML entities are a way of representing an item of data within an XML document, instead of using the data itself. Various entities are built in to the specification of the XML language. For example, the entities `&lt;` and `&gt;` represent the characters `<` and `>`. These are metacharacters used to denote XML tags, and so must generally be represented using their entities when they appear within data.
