Injection attacks often involve injecting payloads that use recognizable patterns, such as HTML tags, JavaScript functions, or SQL statements. As the inputs for these payloads are almost never expected to contain user-supplied code or markup, websites often implement defences that block requests containing these suspicious patterns.
However, these kinds of input filters also need to decode the input in order to check whether it's safe or not. From a security perspective, it's vital that the decoding performed when checking the input is the same as the decoding performed by the back-end server or browser when it eventually uses the data. Any discrepancy can enable an attacker to sneak harmful payloads past the filter by applying different encodings that will automatically be removed later.
