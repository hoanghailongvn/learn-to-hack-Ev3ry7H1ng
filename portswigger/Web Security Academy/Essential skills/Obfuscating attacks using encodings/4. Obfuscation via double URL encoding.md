For some reasons, some servers perform two rounds of URL decoding on any URLs they receive.
This isn't an issue if any security mechanisms also double-decode the input when checking it.

Otherwise, this discrepancy enables an attacker to smuggle malicious input to the back-end by simply encoding it twice.

Ex: `[...]/?search=%253Cimg%2520src%253Dx%2520onerror%253Dalert(1)%253E`

If WAF only decodes this once, it may not be able to identify that the request is dangerous. And if the back-end server subsequently double-decodes this input, the payload will be successfully injected.
