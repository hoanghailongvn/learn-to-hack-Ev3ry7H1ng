- `\u003a`
- ES6: `\u{3a}`

decode location: string context in programming languages, JavaScript engine used by browsers, ... (client side)

Ex: DOM XSS, your input is passed to `eval()` as a string: `eval("\u0061lert(1)")`, this will remain encoded server-side => undetected until the browser decodes it again.

## Leading zeros
ES6-style unicode:
`<a href="javascript\u{0000000003a}alert(1)">Click me</a>
