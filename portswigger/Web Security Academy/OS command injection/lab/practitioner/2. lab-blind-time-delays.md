# [Lab: Blind OS command injection with time delays](https://portswigger.net/web-security/os-command-injection/lab-blind-time-delays)

You can use an injected command that will trigger a time delay, allowing you to confirm that the command was executed based on the time that the application takes to respond. The `ping` command is an effective way to do this, as it lets you specify the number of ICMP packets to send, and therefore the time taken for the command to run:
```
& ping -c 10 127.0.0.1 &
```

This command will cause the application to ping its loopback network adapter for 10 seconds.
