Most SQL injection vulnerabilities arise within the `WHERE` clause of a `SELECT` query. This type of SQL injection is generally well-understood by experienced testers.

But SQL injection vulnerabilities can in principle occur at any location within the query, and within different query types. The most common other locations where SQL injection arises are:

- In `UPDATE` statements, within the updated values or the `WHERE` clause.
- In `INSERT` statements, within the inserted values.
- In `SELECT` statements, within the table or column name.
- In `SELECT` statements, within the ORDER BY clause.
