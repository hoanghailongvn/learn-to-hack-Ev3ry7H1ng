Some core features of the SQL language are implemented in the same way across popular database platforms, and so many ways of detecting and exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities work identically on different types of database.

However, there are also many differences between common databases. These mean that some techniques for detecting and exploiting SQL injection work differently on different platforms. For example:

- Syntax for string concatenation.
- Comments.
- Batched (or stacked) queries.
- Platform-specific APIs.
- Error messages.
