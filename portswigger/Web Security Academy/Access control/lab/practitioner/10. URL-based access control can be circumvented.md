# [Lab: URL-based access control can be circumvented](https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control/lab-url-based-access-control-can-be-circumvented)

This website has an unauthenticated admin panel at  `/admin`, but a front-end system has been configured to block external access to that path. However, the back-end application is built on a framework that supports the  `X-Original-URL`  header.

To solve the lab, access the admin panel and delete the user  `carlos`.
