Historically, websites consisted almost entirely of static files, the path of each request could be mapped 1:1 with the hierarchy of directories and files on the server's filesystem.
Nowadays, websites are increasingly dynamic and the path of a request often has no direct relationship to the file system at all. Nevertheless, web servers still deal with requests for some static files, including stylesheets, images, ...

The process for handling static files is still the same:
- If this file type is non-executable, such as an image or a static HTML page, the server may just send the file's contents to the client in an HTTP response.
- If the file type is executable (php, ...) AND the server is configured to execute files of this type, it will assign variables based on the headers and parameters in the HTTP request before running script. The resulting output may then be sent to the client in an HTTP response.
- If the file type is executable, but the server is not configured to execute files of this type, it will generally respond with an error. However, in some cases, the contents of the file may still be served to the client as plain text. => leak source code and other sensitive information.
