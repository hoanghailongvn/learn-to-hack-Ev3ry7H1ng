The impact of file upload vulnerabilities generally depends on two key factors:

- Which aspect of the file the website fails to validate properly, whether that be its size, type, contents, and so on.
- What restrictions are imposed on the file once it has been successfully uploaded.

Scenario:
- file's type isn't validated properly: upload server-side code file (php, jsp)
- filename isn't validated properly: overwrite critical files.
- filename isn't validated properly + directory traversal: upload files to unanticipated locations
- file's size isn't within expected thresholds: DoS attack, fills disk space
