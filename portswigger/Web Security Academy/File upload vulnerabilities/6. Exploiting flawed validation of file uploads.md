## II. Preventing file execution in user-accessible directories

Thay vì check file type khi người dùng upload, thì thiết lập server để không thực thi code ở các thư mục nhạy cảm như nơi người dùng upload file lên:

- trả về lỗi
- trả về nội dung file (leak source)

## III. Insufficient blacklisting of dangerous file types

blacklisting is inherently flawed as it's difficult to explicitly block every possible file extension that could be used to execute code.

### 1\. Overriding the server configuration

As we discussed in the previous section, servers typically won't execute files unless they have been configured to do so. For example, before an Apache server will execute PHP files requested by a client, developers might have to add the following directives to their `/etc/apache2/apache2.conf` file:

```
LoadModule php_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/libphp.so 
AddType application/x-httpd-php .php
```

Many servers also allow developers to create special configuration files within individual directories in order to override or add to one or more of the global settings. Apache servers, for example, will load a directory-specific configuration from a file called `.htaccess` if one is present.

Similarly, developers can make directory-specific configuration on IIS servers using a `web.config` file. This might include directives such as the following, which in this case allows JSON files to be served to users:

```
<staticContent>
    <mimeMap fileExtension=".json" mimeType="application/json" /> 
</staticContent>
```

Web servers use these kinds of configuration files when present, but you're not normally allowed to access them using HTTP requests. However, you may occasionally find servers that fail to stop you from uploading your own malicious configuration file. In this case, even if the file extension you need is blacklisted, you may be able to trick the server into mapping an arbitrary, custom file extension to an executable MIME type.

### 2\. Obfuscating file extensions

Even the most exhaustive blacklists can potentially be bypassed using classic obfuscation techniques. Let's say the validation code is case sensitive and fails to recognize that `exploit.pHp` is in fact a `.php` file. If the code that subsequently maps the file extension to a MIME type is **not** case sensitive, this discrepancy allows you to sneak malicious PHP files past validation that may eventually be executed by the server.

You can also achieve similar results using the following techniques:

- Provide multiple extensions. Depending on the algorithm used to parse the filename, the following file may be interpreted as either a PHP file or JPG image: `exploit.php.jpg`
- Add trailing characters. Some components will strip or ignore trailing whitespaces, dots, and suchlike: `exploit.php.`
- Try using the URL encoding (or double URL encoding) for dots, forward slashes, and backward slashes. If the value isn't decoded when validating the file extension, but is later decoded server-side, this can also allow you to upload malicious files that would otherwise be blocked: `exploit%2Ephp`
- Add semicolons or URL-encoded null byte characters before the file extension. If validation is written in a high-level language like PHP or Java, but the server processes the file using lower-level functions in C/C++, for example, this can cause discrepancies in what is treated as the end of the filename: `exploit.asp;.jpg` or `exploit.asp%00.jpg`
- Try using multibyte unicode characters, which may be converted to null bytes and dots after unicode conversion or normalization. Sequences like `xC0 x2E`, `xC4 xAE` or `xC0 xAE` may be translated to `x2E` if the filename parsed as a UTF-8 string, but then converted to ASCII characters before being used in a path.

Other defenses involve stripping or replacing dangerous extensions to prevent the file from being executed. If this transformation isn't applied recursively, you can position the prohibited string in such a way that removing it still leaves behind a valid file extension. For example, consider what happens if you strip `.php` from the following filename:

`exploit.p.phphp`

This is just a small selection of the many ways it's possible to obfuscate file extensions.

## IV. Flawed validation of the file's contents

Instead of implicitly trusting the  `Content-Type`  specified in a request, more secure servers try to verify that the contents of the file actually match what is expected.

In the case of an image upload function, the server might try to verify certain intrinsic properties of an image, such as its dimensions. If you try uploading a PHP script, for example, it won't have any dimensions at all. Therefore, the server can deduce that it can't possibly be an image, and reject the upload accordingly.

Similarly, certain file types may always contain a specific sequence of bytes in their header or footer. These can be used like a fingerprint or signature to determine whether the contents match the expected type. For example, JPEG files always begin with the bytes  `FF D8 FF`.

This is a much more robust way of validating the file type, but even this isn't foolproof. Using special tools, such as ExifTool, it can be trivial to create a polyglot JPEG file containing malicious code within its metadata.

## V. Exploiting file upload race conditions
Modern frameworks are more battle-hardened against these kinds of attacks. They generally don't upload files directly to their intended destination on the filesystem. Instead, they take precautions like uploading to a temporary, sandboxed directory first and randomizing the name to avoid overwriting existing files. They then perform validation on this temporary file and only transfer it to its destination once it is deemed safe to do so.

That said, developers sometimes implement their own processing of file uploads independently of any framework. Not only is this fairly complex to do well, it can also introduce dangerous race conditions that enable an attacker to completely bypass even the most robust validation.

For example, some websites upload the file directly to the main filesystem and then remove it again if it doesn't pass validation. This kind of behavior is typical in websites that rely on anti-virus software and the like to check for malware. This may only take a few milliseconds, but for the short time that the file exists on the server, the attacker can potentially still execute it.

These vulnerabilities are often extremely subtle, making them difficult to detect during blackbox testing unless you can find a way to leak the relevant source code.
