Identifying SSTI vulnerabilities and crafting a successful attack typically involves the following high-level process.

## I. Detect

SSTI vulnerabilities often go unnoticed not because they are complex but because they are only really apparent to auditors who are explicitly looking for them. If you are able to detect that a vulnerability is present, it can be surprisingly easy to exploit it. This is especially true in unsandboxed environments.

As with any vulnerability, the first step towards exploitation is being able to find it. Perhaps the simplest initial approach is to try **fuzzing the template** by injecting a sequence of special characters commonly used in template expressions, such as `${{<%[%'"}}%\`. If an exception is raised, this indicates that the injected template syntax is potentially being interpreted by the server in some way. This is one sign that a vulnerability to server-side template injection may exist.

Server-side template injection vulnerabilities occur in two distinct contexts, each of which requires its own detection method. Regardless of the results of your fuzzing attempts, it is important to also try the following context-specific approaches. If fuzzing was inconclusive, a vulnerability may still reveal itself using one of these approaches. Even if fuzzing did suggest a template injection vulnerability, you still need to identify its context in order to exploit it.

### 1\. Plaintext context

Most template languages allow you to freely input content either by using HTML tags directly or by using the template's native syntax, which will be rendered to HTML on the back-end before the HTTP response is sent. For example, in Freemarker, the line `render('Hello ' + username)` would render to something like `Hello Carlos`.

This can sometimes be exploited for [XSS](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting) and is in fact **often mistaken for a simple XSS vulnerability**. However, by setting mathematical operations as the value of the parameter, we can test whether this is also a **potential entry point for a SSTI attack**.

For example, consider a template that contains the following vulnerable code:

```
render('Hello ' + username)
```

During auditing, we might test for SSTI by requesting a URL such as:

```
http://vulnerable-website.com/?username=${7*7}
```

If the resulting output contains  `Hello 49`, this shows that the mathematical operation is being evaluated server-side. This is a good POC for a SSTI vulnerability.

Note that the specific syntax required to successfully evaluate the mathematical operation will vary depending on which template engine is being used. We'll discuss this in more detail in the  [Identify](https://portswigger.net/web-security/server-side-template-injection#identify)  step.
### 2. Code context
