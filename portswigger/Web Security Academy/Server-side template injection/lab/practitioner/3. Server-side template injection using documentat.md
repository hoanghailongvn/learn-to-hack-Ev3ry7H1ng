# [Lab: Server-side template injection using documentation](https://portswigger.net/web-security/server-side-template-injection/exploiting/lab-server-side-template-injection-using-documentation)

## Lab

This lab is vulnerable to  [server-side template injection](https://portswigger.net/web-security/server-side-template-injection). To solve the lab, identify the template engine and use the documentation to work out how to execute arbitrary code, then delete the  `morale.txt`  file from Carlos's home directory.
