SSTI vulnerabilities can expose websites to a variety of attacks depending on the template engine in question and how exactly the application uses it. **In certain rare circumstances, these vulnerabilities pose no real security risk**. However, most of the time, the impact of server-side template injection can be catastrophic.

At the severe end of the scale, an attacker can potentially achieve **rce**, taking full control of the back-end server and using it to perform other attacks on internal infrastructure.

Even in cases where full rce is not possible, an attacker can often still use SSTI as the basis for **numerous other attacks, potentially gaining read acces to sensitive data and arbitrary files on the server**.
