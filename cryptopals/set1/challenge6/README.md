# **[set 1 - challenge 6](https://cryptopals.com/sets/1/challenges/6): Break repeating-key XOR**

There's a file here. It's been base64'd after being encrypted with repeating-key XOR.

Decrypt it.

Here's how:

1. Let KEYSIZE be the guessed length of the key; try values from 2 to (say) 40.
2. Write a function to compute the edit distance/Hamming distance between two strings. The Hamming distance is just the number of differing bits. The distance between:

    ```text
    this is a test
    ```

    and

    ```text
    wokka wokka!!!
    ```

    is 37. Make sure your code agrees before you proceed.

3. For each KEYSIZE, take the first KEYSIZE worth of bytes, and the second KEYSIZE worth of bytes, and find the edit distance between them. Normalize this result by dividing by KEYSIZE.
4. The KEYSIZE with the smallest normalized edit distance is probably the key. You could proceed perhaps with the smallest 2-3 KEYSIZE values. Or take 4 KEYSIZE blocks instead of 2 and average the distances.
5. Now that you probably know the KEYSIZE: break the ciphertext into blocks of KEYSIZE length.
6. Now transpose the blocks: make a block that is the first byte of every block, and a block that is the second byte of every block, and so on.
7. Solve each block as if it was single-character XOR. You already have code to do this.
8. For each block, the single-byte XOR key that produces the best looking histogram is the repeating-key XOR key byte for that block. Put them together and you have the key.

This code is going to turn out to be surprisingly useful later on. Breaking repeating-key XOR ("Vigenere") statistically is obviously an academic exercise, a "Crypto 101" thing. But more people "know how" to break it than can actually break it, and a similar technique breaks something much more important.

## Hamming distance

Hamming distance between 2 strings is the total number of different bits:

```python
def hamming_distance(input1: bytes, input2: bytes):
    ret = 0
    
    for i in range(len(input1)):
        bin1 = f"{input1[i]:08b}"
        bin2 = f"{input2[i]:08b}"

        for j in range(8):
            if bin1[j] is not bin2[j]:
                ret += 1
    
    return ret
```

## Why we can find KEYSIZE with hamming distance

Perfect answer for this question [here](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/8118)

Hamming distance between two random English letters, encoded in ASCII has a high probability that it will be smaller than the hamming distance between two random 8-bit bytes.

So with the correct KEYSIZE, the hamming distance between blocks will be small and vice versa.

## Solutions

- Step 1: decode ciphertext báº±ng base64:

    ```python
    ciphertext = base64.b64decode(file.read())
    ```

- Step 2: Find KEYSIZE with hamming distance:
  - score_KEYSIZE function:
    - Split the ciphertext into blocks of size `KEYSIZE`
    - Sum the hamming distance between blocks 0 and 1, 1 and 2, 2 and 3, ...
    - Divide by `KEYSIZE` to normalize
    - Divide by the number of calculated hamming distances

    ```python
    def score_KEYSIZE(ciphertext: bytes, KEYSIZE: int):
        max_nb_block = len(ciphertext) // KEYSIZE - 1
        
        score = 0
        for i in range(max_nb_block):
            score += hamming_distance(ciphertext[KEYSIZE * i: KEYSIZE * (i + 1)], ciphertext[KEYSIZE * (i + 1): KEYSIZE * (i + 2)])
        
        score /= KEYSIZE
        score /= max_nb_block

        return score
    ```

  - guess_KEYSIZE function returns the `KEYSIZE` that has smallest score_KEYSIZE value:

    ```python
    def guess_KEYSIZE(ciphertext: bytes):
        min = inf
        ret = -1
        for KEYSIZE in range(2, 40):
            score = score_KEYSIZE(ciphertext, KEYSIZE)
            if min > score:
                min = score
                ret = KEYSIZE

        return ret
    ```

- B3: With the correct `KEYSIZE`, we can simplify the `crack repeating-key XOR` problem to multiple `crack Single-byte XOR` problems, for example:
  - plaintext: "MESSAGETEXT" encrypted by `repeating-key XOR` with the key "ICE"
  - => 3 plaintext "MSEX", "EATT", "SGE" encrypted by `single-byte XOR` with key is "I", "C", "E" respectively:

  - reuse the cracking_single_xor function written in [challenge 3](../challenge3/):

    ```python
    def cracking_repeat_xor(ciphertext: bytes):
        guessed_keysize = guess_KEYSIZE(ciphertext)
        print(f"guessed keysize: {guessed_keysize}")

        key = []
        for i in range(guessed_keysize):
            temp_key, _, _ = cracking_single_xor((([ciphertext[c] for c in range(i, len(ciphertext), guessed_keysize)])))
            key.append(temp_key)

        print(bytes(key))
        print(repeating_key_xor(ciphertext, bytes(key)).decode())
    ```

put it all together:

```python
import base64
from cmath import inf
import string
import freqAnalysis

def hamming_distance(input1: bytes, input2: bytes):
    ret = 0
    
    for i in range(len(input1)):
        bin1 = f"{input1[i]:08b}"
        bin2 = f"{input2[i]:08b}"

        for j in range(8):
            if bin1[j] is not bin2[j]:
                ret += 1
    
    return ret

def repeating_key_xor(msg: bytes, key: bytes):
    ciphertext = []

    for i, c in enumerate(msg):
        ciphertext.append(msg[i] ^ key[i % len(key)])
    
    return bytes(ciphertext)

def score_KEYSIZE(ciphertext: bytes, KEYSIZE: int):
    max_nb_block = len(ciphertext) // KEYSIZE - 1
    
    score = 0
    for i in range(max_nb_block):
        score += hamming_distance(ciphertext[KEYSIZE * i: KEYSIZE * (i + 1)], ciphertext[KEYSIZE * (i + 1): KEYSIZE * (i + 2)])
    
    score /= KEYSIZE
    score /= max_nb_block

    return score

def guess_KEYSIZE(ciphertext: bytes, size_start=2, size_end=40):
    min = inf
    ret = -1
    for KEYSIZE in range(size_start, size_end):
        score = score_KEYSIZE(ciphertext, KEYSIZE)
        if min > score:
            min = score
            ret = KEYSIZE

    return ret
        
def cracking_single_xor(b_ciphertext: bytes):
    max_score = -inf
    b_final_plaintext = b""
    final_key = -1

    for key in range(256):
        b_temp_plaintext = bytes(c ^ key for c in b_ciphertext)

        # b'0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ!"#$%&\'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~ \t\n\r\x0b\x0c'
        b_string_printable = bytes(string.printable, 'ascii')

        if all(p in b_string_printable for p in b_temp_plaintext):
            s = freqAnalysis.englishFreqMatchScore(b_temp_plaintext.decode('ascii'))
            if max_score < s:
                final_key = key
                max_score = s
                b_final_plaintext = b_temp_plaintext

    return final_key, max_score, b_final_plaintext

def cracking_repeat_xor(ciphertext: bytes):
    guessed_keysize = guess_KEYSIZE(ciphertext)
    print(f"guessed keysize: {guessed_keysize}")

    key = []
    for i in range(guessed_keysize):
        temp_key, _, _ = cracking_single_xor((([ciphertext[c] for c in range(i, len(ciphertext), guessed_keysize)])))
        key.append(temp_key)

    return bytes(key), repeating_key_xor(ciphertext, bytes(key))

    print(bytes(key))
    print(repeating_key_xor(ciphertext, bytes(key)).decode())


if __name__ == "__main__":
    with open("6.txt", "r") as file:
        ciphertext = base64.b64decode(file.read())
        file.close()

        key, b_plaintext = cracking_repeat_xor(ciphertext)
        print(f"Key: {key}")
        print(f"Plaintext: \n{b_plaintext.decode()}")
```

Result:

```text
guessed keysize: 29
Key: b'Terminator X: Bring the noise'
Plaintext: 
I'm back and I'm ringin' the bell
A rockin' on the mike while the fly girls yell
In ecstasy in the back of me
Well that's my DJ Deshay cuttin' all them Z's
Hittin' hard and the girlies goin' crazy
Vanilla's on the mike, man I'm not lazy.

I'm lettin' my drug kick in
It controls my mouth and I begin
To just let it flow, let my concepts go
My posse's to the side yellin', Go Vanilla Go!

Smooth 'cause that's the way I will be
And if you don't give a damn, then
Why you starin' at me
So get off 'cause I control the stage
There's no dissin' allowed
I'm in my own phase
The girlies sa y they love me and that is ok
And I can dance better than any kid n' play

Stage 2 -- Yea the one ya' wanna listen to
It's off my head so let the beat play through
So I can funk it up and make it sound good
1-2-3 Yo -- Knock on some wood
For good luck, I like my rhymes atrocious
Supercalafragilisticexpialidocious
I'm an effect and that you can bet
I can take a fly girl and make her wet.

I'm like Samson -- Samson to Delilah
There's no denyin', You can try to hang
But you'll keep tryin' to get my style
Over and over, practice makes perfect
But not if you're a loafer.

You'll get nowhere, no place, no time, no girls
Soon -- Oh my God, homebody, you probably eat
Spaghetti with a spoon! Come on and say it!

VIP. Vanilla Ice yep, yep, I'm comin' hard like a rhino
Intoxicating so you stagger like a wino
So punks stop trying and girl stop cryin'
Vanilla Ice is sellin' and you people are buyin'
'Cause why the freaks are jockin' like Crazy Glue
Movin' and groovin' trying to sing along
All through the ghetto groovin' this here song
Now you're amazed by the VIP posse.

Steppin' so hard like a German Nazi
Startled by the bases hittin' ground
There's no trippin' on mine, I'm just gettin' down
Sparkamatic, I'm hangin' tight like a fanatic
You trapped me once and I thought that
You might have it
So step down and lend me your ear
'89 in my time! You, '90 is my year.

You're weakenin' fast, YO! and I can tell it
Your body's gettin' hot, so, so I can smell it
So don't be mad and don't be sad
'Cause the lyrics belong to ICE, You can call me Dad
You're pitchin' a fit, so step back and endure
Let the witch doctor, Ice, do the dance to cure
So come up close and don't be square
You wanna battle me -- Anytime, anywhere

You thought that I was weak, Boy, you're dead wrong
So come on, everybody and sing this song

Say -- Play that funky music Say, go white boy, go white boy go
play that funky music Go white boy, go white boy, go
Lay down and boogie and play that funky music till you die.

Play that funky music Come on, Come on, let me hear
Play that funky music white boy you say it, say it
Play that funky music A little louder now
Play that funky music, white boy Come on, Come on, Come on
Play that funky music
```
