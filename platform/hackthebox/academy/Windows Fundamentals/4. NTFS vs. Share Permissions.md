# [NTFS vs. Share Permissions](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/49/section/1017)

Server Message Block protocol (SMB): connect shared resources like files and printers, used in large, medium and small enterprise environments.

## Share permissions

| --- | --- |
| Full Control | all actions given by Change and Read permissions, change permissions for NTFS files and subfolders |
