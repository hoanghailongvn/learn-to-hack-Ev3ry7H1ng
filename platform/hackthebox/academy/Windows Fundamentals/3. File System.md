- File Explorer GUI under the security tab
- command line: `icacls` utility

```cmd
C:\htb> icacls c:\windows
c:\windows NT SERVICE\TrustedInstaller:(F)
           NT SERVICE\TrustedInstaller:(CI)(IO)(F)
           NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(M)
           NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(OI)(CI)(IO)(F)
           BUILTIN\Administrators:(M)
           BUILTIN\Administrators:(OI)(CI)(IO)(F)
           BUILTIN\Users:(RX)
           BUILTIN\Users:(OI)(CI)(IO)(GR,GE)
           CREATOR OWNER:(OI)(CI)(IO)(F)
           APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES:(RX)
           APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES:(OI)(CI)(IO)(GR,GE)
