redis

## Task 3: What type of database is Redis? Choose from the following options: (i) In-memory Database, (ii) Traditional Database

answer: In-memory Database

An in-memory database is a database management system that primarily relies on main memory for computer data storage. It is contrasted with database management systems that employ a disk storage mechanism.

## Task 4: Which command-line utility is used to interact with the Redis server? Enter the program name you would enter into the terminal without any arguments

redis-cli

## Task 5: Which flag is used with the Redis command-line utility to specify the hostname?

answer: -h

```bash
┌──(realkali㉿SeaDragnoL)-[~]
└─$ redis-cli -h
redis-cli 7.0.7

Usage: redis-cli [OPTIONS] [cmd [arg [arg ...]]]
  -h <hostname>      Server hostname (default: 127.0.0.1).
  -p <port>          Server port (default: 6379).
...
```

## Task 6: Once connected to a Redis server, which command is used to obtain the information and statistics about the Redis server?

info

## Task 7: What is the version of the Redis server being used on the target machine?

5.0.7

```redis
10.129.224.59:6379> info
# Server
redis_version:5.0.7
redis_git_sha1:00000000
redis_git_dirty:0  
...
```

## Task 8: Which command is used to select the desired database in Redis?

select

## Task 9: How many keys are present inside the database with index 0?

4

```redis
10.129.224.59:6379> info keyspace
# Keyspace
db0:keys=4,expires=0,avg_ttl=0
```

As a dictionary, Redis allows you to set and retrieve pairs of keys and values. Think of a “key” as a unique identifier (string, integer, etc.) and a “value” as whatever data you want to associate with that key.

## Task 10: Which command is used to obtain all the keys in a database?

KEYS *

```redis
10.129.224.59:6379> KEYS *
1) "stor"
2) "temp"
3) "numb"
4) "flag"
```

## Task 11: Submit root flag

03e1d2b376c37ab3f5319922053953eb

```redis
10.129.224.59:6379> GET flag
"03e1d2b376c37ab3f5319922053953eb"
```
