Nmap scan report for 10.129.196.200
Host is up (0.25s latency).

PORT   STATE SERVICE
23/tcp open  telnet
```

answer: telnet

TELNET is commonly used by terminal emulation programs that allow you to log into a remote host. However, TELNET can also be used for terminal-to-terminal communication and interprocess communication. TELNET is also used by other protocols (for example, FTP) for establishing a protocol control channel. (google)

## Task 8: What username is able to log into the target over telnet with a blank password?

configuration mistakes, try logging with some important accounts without password:
