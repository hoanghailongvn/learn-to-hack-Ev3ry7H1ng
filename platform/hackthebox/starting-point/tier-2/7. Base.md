## login.php.swp

A `.swp` file is a temporary file created by Vim when editing a file. use `vim -r` to recover.

`vim -r login.php.swp`

```php
<?php
session_start();
if (!empty($_POST['username']) && !empty($_POST['password'])) {
    require('config.php');
    if (strcmp($username, $_POST['username']) == 0) {
        if (strcmp($password, $_POST['password']) == 0) {
            $_SESSION['user_id'] = 1;
            header("Location: /upload.php");
        } else {
            print("<script>alert('Wrong Username or Password')</script>");
        }
    } else {
