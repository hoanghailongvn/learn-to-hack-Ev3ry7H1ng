## Task 1: What does the 3-letter acronym SMB stand for?

Server Message Block

The Server Message Block (SMB) protocol is a network file sharing protocol that allows applications on a computer to read and write to files and to request services from server programs in a computer network.

## Task 2: What port does SMB use to operate at?

445

## Task 3: What is the service name for port 445 that came up in our Nmap scan?

answer: microsoft-ds

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ nmap -sV -p 445 10.129.46.159
Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-09-16 04:45 EDT

```

## Task 4: What is the 'flag' or 'switch' we can use with the SMB tool to 'list' the contents of the share?

answer: -L

man:

```text
 -L|--list
This option allows you to look at what services are available on a server. You use it as smbclient -L host
and a list should appear. The -I option may be useful if your NetBIOS names don't match your TCP/IP DNS
host names or if you are trying to reach a host on another network.
```

## Task 5: How many shares are there on Dancing?

answer: 4

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ smbclient -L 10.129.46.159
Password for [WORKGROUP\kali]:

        Sharename       Type      Comment
        ---------       ----      -------
        ADMIN$          Disk      Remote Admin
        C$              Disk      Default share
        IPC$            IPC       Remote IPC
        WorkShares      Disk      
Reconnecting with SMB1 for workgroup listing.
do_connect: Connection to 10.129.46.159 failed (Error NT_STATUS_RESOURCE_NAME_NOT_FOUND)
Unable to connect with SMB1 -- no workgroup available
```

## Task 6: What is the name of the share we are able to access in the end with a blank password?

answer: workshares

```bash
┌──(realkali㉿SeaDragnoL)-[~]
└─$ smbclient '\\10.129.85.200\WorkShares' -N
Try "help" to get a list of possible commands.
smb: \>
```

`-N` flag means no password

## Task 7: What is the command we can use within the SMB shell to download the files we find?

answer: get

```bash
┌──(realkali㉿SeaDragnoL)-[~]
└─$ smbclient '\\10.129.85.200\WorkShares' -N
Try "help" to get a list of possible commands.
