# [Lab: HTTP/2 request smuggling via CRLF injection](https://portswigger.net/web-security/request-smuggling/advanced/lab-request-smuggling-h2-request-smuggling-via-crlf-injection)

## Lab

This lab is vulnerable to request smuggling because the front-end server downgrades HTTP/2 requests and fails to adequately sanitize incoming headers.

To solve the lab, use an HTTP/2-exclusive request smuggling vector to gain access to another user's account. The victim accesses the home page every 15 seconds.

If you're not familiar with Burp's exclusive features for HTTP/2 testing, please refer to the documentation for details on how to use them.
