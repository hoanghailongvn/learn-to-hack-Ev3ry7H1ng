# [Lab: SSRF with whitelist-based input filter](https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf/lab-ssrf-with-whitelist-filter)

Lỗ hổng: chống ssrf bằng cách sử dụng whitelist-based

Some applications only allow input that matches, begins with, or contains, a whitelist of permitted values. In this situation, you can sometimes circumvent the filter by exploiting inconsistencies in URL parsing.

The URL specification contains a number of features that are liable to be overlooked when implementing ad hoc parsing and validation of URLs:

- You can embed credentials in a URL before the hostname, using the @ character. For example: `https://expected-host@evil-host`
- You can use the `#` character to indicate a URL fragment. For example: `https://evil-host#expected-host`
- You can leverage the DNS naming hierarchy to place required input into a fully-qualified DNS name that you control. For example: `https://expected-host.evil-host`
- You can URL-encode characters to confuse the URL-parsing code. This is particularly useful if the code that implements the filter handles URL-encoded characters differently than the code that performs the back-end HTTP request.

You can use combinations of these techniques together.
