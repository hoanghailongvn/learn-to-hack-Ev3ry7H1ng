# [Lab: Basic SSRF against another back-end system](https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf/lab-basic-ssrf-against-backend-system)

## Lab

This lab has a stock check feature which fetches data from an internal system.

To solve the lab, use the stock check functionality to scan the internal `192.168.0.X` range for an admin interface on port 8080, then use it to delete the user `carlos`.

## Analysis

Same as [lab-1](./1.%20Basic%20SSRF%20against%20the%20local%20server.md)
