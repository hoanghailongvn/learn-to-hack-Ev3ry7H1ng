There are various types of XXE attacks:

- [Exploiting XXE to retrieve files](https://portswigger.net/web-security/xxe#exploiting-xxe-to-retrieve-files), where an external entity is defined containing the contents of a file, and returned in the application's response.
- [Exploiting XXE to perform SSRF attacks](https://portswigger.net/web-security/xxe#exploiting-xxe-to-perform-ssrf-attacks), where an external entity is defined based on a URL to a back-end system.
- [Exploiting blind XXE exfiltrate data out-of-band](https://portswigger.net/web-security/xxe/blind#exploiting-blind-xxe-to-exfiltrate-data-out-of-band), where sensitive data is transmitted from the application server to a system that the attacker controls.
- [Exploiting blind XXE to retrieve data via error messages](https://portswigger.net/web-security/xxe/blind#exploiting-blind-xxe-to-retrieve-data-via-error-messages), where the attacker can trigger a parsing error message containing sensitive data.
