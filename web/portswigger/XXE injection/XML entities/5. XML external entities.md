XML external entities are a type of custom entity whose definition is located outside of the DTD where they are declared.

The declaration of an external entity uses the  `SYSTEM`  keyword and must specify a URL from which the value of the entity should be loaded. For example:

```
<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY ext SYSTEM "http://normal-website.com" > ]>
```

The URL can use the  `file://`  protocol, and so external entities can be loaded from file. For example:

```
<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY ext SYSTEM "file:///path/to/file" > ]>
```

XML external entities provide the primary means by which  [XML external entity attacks](https://portswigger.net/web-security/xxe)  arise.
