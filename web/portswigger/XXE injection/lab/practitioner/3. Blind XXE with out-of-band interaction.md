# [Lab: Blind XXE with out-of-band interaction](https://portswigger.net/web-security/xxe/blind/lab-xxe-with-out-of-band-interaction)

This lab has a "Check stock" feature that parses XML input but does not display the result.

You can detect the  [blind XXE](https://portswigger.net/web-security/xxe/blind)  vulnerability by triggering out-of-band interactions with an external domain.

To solve the lab, use an external entity to make the XML parser issue a DNS lookup and HTTP request to Burp Collaborator.
