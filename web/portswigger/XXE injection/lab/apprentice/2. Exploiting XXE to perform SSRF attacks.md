# [Lab: Exploiting XXE to perform SSRF attacks](https://portswigger.net/web-security/xxe/lab-exploiting-xxe-to-perform-ssrf)

This lab has a "Check stock" feature that parses XML input and returns any unexpected values in the response.

The lab server is running a (simulated) EC2 metadata endpoint at the default URL, which is  `http://169.254.169.254/`. This endpoint can be used to retrieve data about the instance, some of which might be sensitive.

To solve the lab, exploit the  [XXE](https://portswigger.net/web-security/xxe)  vulnerability to perform an  [SSRF attack](https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf)  that obtains the server's IAM secret access key from the EC2 metadata endpoint.

## Solution
