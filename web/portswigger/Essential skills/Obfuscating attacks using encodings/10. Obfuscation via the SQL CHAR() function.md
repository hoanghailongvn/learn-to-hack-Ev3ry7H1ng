In SQLi attack, we can use:
- `CHAR(83)` | `CHAR(0x53)` -> `S`

By concatenating the returned values, you can use this approach to obfuscate blocked keywords. For example, even if `SELECT` is blacklisted, the following injection initially appears harmless:

```
CHAR(83)+CHAR(69)+CHAR(76)+CHAR(69)+CHAR(67)+CHAR(84)
```
However, when this is processed as SQL by the application, it will dynamically construct the SELECT keyword and execute the injected query.
