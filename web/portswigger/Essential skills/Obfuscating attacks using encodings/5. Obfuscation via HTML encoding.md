In HTML documents, certain characters need to be escaped or encoded to prevent the browser from incorrectly interpreting them as part of the markup:
- name: `&colon;`
- decimal: `&#58`
- hex: `&#x3a`

In specific locations within the HTML, such as the text content of an element or the value of an attribute, browsers will automatically decode these references when they parse the document. When injecting inside such a location, you can occasionally take advantage of this to obfuscate payloads for client-side attacks, hiding them from any server-side defences that are in place.

Ex: `<img src=x onerror="&#x61;lert(1)">`
- server not spot this `alert()`
- browser renders the page, it will decode and execute the injected payload.

## Leading zeros

lmao: `<a href="javascript&#00000000000058;alert(1)">Click me</a>
` still ok
