Broadly speaking, most vulnerabilities in authentication mechanisms arise in one of two ways:

- \- The authentication mechanisms are weak because they fail to adequately protect against brute-force attacks.
- \- Logic flaws or poor coding in the implementation allow the authentication mechanisms to be bypassed entirely by an attacker. This is sometimes referred to as "broken authentication".

In many areas of web development,  [logic flaws](https://portswigger.net/web-security/logic-flaws)  will simply cause the website to behave unexpectedly, which may or may not be a security issue. However, as authentication is so critical to security, the likelihood that flawed authentication logic exposes the website to security issues is clearly elevated.
